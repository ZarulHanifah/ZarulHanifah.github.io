**Serving the community**. Whether it is workshops or analysing data, we aim to serve our community in the best way we know how.

**Meticulous**. We are our toughest critics and this means we are very critical of our work to make sure we provide the best service we possibily can.

## Writing

Science isnt always understood and we aim to write in such a way that makes scientific communication easier to understand. Also, to sharpen our writing skills, we ensure that our work is looked from the different lenses from each of our specific skills and backgrounds, we ensure each member contributes to writing something.

Knowledge without action is wastefulness and action without knowledge is foolishness.
