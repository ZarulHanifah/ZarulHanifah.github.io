## Internships

![](/images/miscellaneous/opportunities.jpeg){:.center-img .width-60}

Currently we are interested in people who:
- Have computational experience 
- Wish to do `microbiology`/`environment`/`pathogen` research
- Indulge in nature


If you are an undergraduate student or an intern who is looking for a challenging but potentially fruitful project related to the human microbiome and/or bioinformatics, please send an e-mail to fastgenom at gmail.com.

Or, if some of these keywords apply to you, please consider sending a CV along with a very short description of your background and research interests to fastgenom at gmail.com to start a conversation:
`Coding` `Bioinformatics` `Pangenomics` `Microbiome` `Metagenomics` `Metatranscriptomics` `Python` `Linux` `Phylogenetics/Phylogenomics` `Scientific visualization` `Pathogen surveillance` `Nanopore` `eDNA`
