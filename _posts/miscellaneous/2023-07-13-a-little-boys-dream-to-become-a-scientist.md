This blog is about my experiences that I have gained so far as I complete my PhD and I hope that sharing my journey will ignite a spark in people as the one I had so many years ago.

My aptitude for the natural sciences was always apparent even when I was in kindergarten. Back then, I would catch and look for scorpions, grasshoppers and the likes examining them with awe. I remembered after the flooding season, I would follow my grandfather and father out to catch fish that were stranded in pools at the side of the roads, orchards and in small drains. That was my first exposure to the beauty of the fishes caught; amused by their array of shapes and colours. That first feeling of excitement, wonder and fascination is still something that I hold dearly to this day. This was the spark that started it all.

Now at 26 I am doing a PhD on the very topic that directly ties down to those feelings I had 20 years ago. My PhD project is something I am very proud of doing. It is the assessment of the ecology and genetics of peat swamp fishes of North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest. This project requires that I survey peat ecosystems that are nothing short of challenging. It is a labor intensive project and requires a strong survival skill, lots of stamina, and good interpersonal skills.

Despite the dangers of having to go into the forest and knowing its dangers. My eyes light up with excitement every time I traverse through the dense forests thick with thorns, wade through knee deep mud and swim through deep canals. All of it were not for naught as the fish diversity I saw in these ecosystems were astounding! Cataloging over 50 different species of fishes from all manner of shapes, colours and forms.

Fieldwork at the Trusan river, Lawas in the highlands of Sarawak though hours of timber roads and kilometers of hiking.

One of the most notable is the beautiful Pearl Gourami (Trichopodus leerii) caught at one of my sites. Observe the iridescent green colours with the pearly white scales that are outline by the black circles.

I also had the pleasure to record the smallest fish in the world which is Paedocypris progenetica, with the adults reaching the size of a fingernail. A species so rare that I had to venture kilometers deep in the forest traversing the river by boat and then on foot.

There are so many more exciting stories I have to tell. We are simply scratching the surface. I wouldn’t have been able live my childhood dream if it weren’t for my PhD. Because of this PhD, I am able to share the knowledge that was once locked away in the forest with everyone effectively and have a greater and wider impact.  I hope that my findings will become the building blocks towards conservation to these fragile ecosystems. 

I hope you will join me in my journey to explore the hidden wonders of our world.

Hari ni saya ada jumpa burung special di kawasan kajian saya, ini ialah enggang badak atau burung kenyalang. Dia boleh dikenali dgn paruh berwarna merah yg bertanduk. Inilah burung kebanggaan Sarawak. Sekarang ni dia sdg menikmati buah kegemaran dia iaitu buah ara. Boleh tgk dia lompat2 ambik buah di sana.
